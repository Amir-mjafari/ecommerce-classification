# ecommerce-classification
I used Keras library to train a Convolutional Neural Network Model to classify 21627 noisy images of e-commerce products into 27 categories. Due to the availability of corresponding text descriptions and categorical features, I implemented a Transformer Model (pre-trained BERT) with PyTorch library to process the text data. The ensemble of the two mentioned models achieved 96 percent accuracy.

The data includes noisy images and text descriptions for each e-commerce product. Text descriptions are uploaded in CSV files. Due to limitations in uploading files bigger than 100MB in CLI, I just uploaded a few sample images of the project.

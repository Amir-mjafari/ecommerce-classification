# ecommerce-classification
I used Keras library to train a Convolutional Neural Network Model to classify 21627 noisy images of e-commerce products into 27 categories. Due to the availability of corresponding text descriptions and categorical features, I implemented a Transformer Model (pre-trained BERT) with PyTorch library to process the text data. The ensemble of the two mentioned models achieved 96 percent accuracy.
